A nodejs implementation of the Classical game of Chowka bhara with :

A. Attacking rules
B. Pairing rules (Gatti)
C. Safe house (Gatta)
D. Multi-Player options

1. Each player gets 4 pawns. Goal of the game is to take all 4 pawns to the center of the grid via defined pathway, specific to the player.
2. Every time, player rolls his dice to get one of these values - 1,2,3,4,8. If a player gets 4 or 8, he gets to roll the dice again. 
3. Each player has to kill at least one pawn of his opponent to enter the inner circle. 
	For each kill, a player gets a free roll of dice.
4. Safe houses : Boxes marked with X are safe houses. Here, opponents cannot kill the pawn. (It will be usually other player's home box)
5. Gatti : It 2 pawns of same player are put in the same box (other than safe house) - it is called gatti. This can be done only in the inner circle. 
	Once gatti is formed, a player cannot separate the pawns. 
	They have to be moved together (only in multiples of 2). If a player gets 2, then he can move gatti one box ahead only.
	A gatti can kill a single pawn but a single pawn cannot kill a gatti. A gatti can be killed by another gatti only.
	2 gattis of same player cannot be in the same box.
6. If the values are beyond game play - then the turn has to be forfeited. 
7. If a player has multiple dice values, he can move any pawn for any value - need not guarantee the order.
